Chronic kidney disease prediction:
 
As the day-to-day life of people in society becomes more and more modernized and extended, Chronic
Kidney Disease (CKD) has also found widespread and contributes to deterioration in the functionality
of kidney function. They may suffer from the disease once any person gets CKD, which can decrease
their working capacity as well as living efficiency. Other chronic disorders such as high blood pressure,
anemia, weak bones due to poor dietary health and nerve damage are also easily caused. Kidney disease,
meanwhile, maximizes the likelihood of patients developing heart and blood-oriented diseases. Such
chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and other illnesses, also cause chronic kidney
disease. In this project, after testing the ability of six algorithms for prediction of the kidney disease, I have 
created an integrated model with the best two performing algorithms. The dataset has been collected from the University of
California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository which had a large number of missing values. These
missing values were filled using KNN imputer. After successfully filling out the missing values, six
machine learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbor, random forest, naive bayes, logistic regression,
support vector machine and feed forward neural network) are implemented and those models are
analyzed. Then an integrated model is developed combining random forest and logistic regression (the
best two performing algorithms) by using perceptron. After ten times of simulation the developed model
achieved an accuracy of 98.83%. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that this approach will be
applicable to real medical data for disease diagnosis.
